## Welcome to the TAG

Hello there, hope you've had a great week ðŸ™‚

Thank you for applying to the FY22 Developer TAG. You're on the list now as a member candidate! The only follow-up we need is a confirmation from your Director that they sponsor you to participate.

As part of the application submission, an automated process sent your manager a notice, and an approval email to your director. If you could follow up with them and confirm they have submitted approval that would be helpful.

Thanks much!
